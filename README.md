# urw_trophyMount
A mod for mounting antlers in UnReal World

Download and toss into your URW main install directory -- add the .png to the "truetile" folder there, and you're good!

Of course it's entirely possible you know more about how antler mounting worked in iron age times - if you do, let me know! I'd be happy to modify this to be more realistic.

Also the art sucks. Sorry. Programmer art.
